THURSDAY GOALS

1. Let exit happen at any time.

4. Merciless refactoring to separate modules better and add tests
    - User class is way too big, probably need a marshaler for all the switches
    - Word checker class which takes board and move and throws the exceptions


// For later:
- Save game states in files serialized by user IDs.
